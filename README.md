## 1. Prime Number Checker

- **Description**: Checks whether a given number is prime or not.
- **Concepts Used**: Loops, conditionals.
- **Input**: A natural number.
- **Output**: Indicates whether the number is prime.

## 2. Multiplication Quiz

- **Description**: Generates two random numbers, asks the user to calculate their product, and verifies the user's answer.
- **Concepts Used**: Random number generation, user input, conditional checks.
- **Input**: User-provided product of two random numbers.
- **Output**: Whether the user's answer is correct, along with the correct product if incorrect.

## 3. Squares of Numbers in Range

- **Description**: Prints squares of all even or odd numbers in the range 100 to 200, based on user choice.
- **Concepts Used**: Loops, conditional checks.
- **Input**: User's choice ('even' or 'odd').
- **Output**: Numbers and their squares.

## 4. Word Count Program

- **Description**: Counts the frequency of each word in a given text.
- **Concepts Used**: String manipulation, dictionaries, loops.
- **Input**: A string of text.
- **Output**: Frequency of each word.

## 5. Palindrome Checker

- **Description**: Checks whether a given string is a palindrome.
- **Concepts Used**: String slicing, conditional checks.
- **Input**: A string.
- **Output**: `True` if the string is a palindrome, `False` otherwise.
